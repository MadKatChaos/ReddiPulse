Overview

Welcome to the Subreddit Sentiment Tracker! This project is all about diving deep into public subreddits, starting with r/rant, to explore emotional trends leading up to major events like elections. My aim is to analyze the general mood and sentiment shifts over time using keywords as a measurement unit.

Purpose

I’m curious about what the vibe is in the days leading up to elections and how feelings in the comments reflect that. This tool will help visualize those trends and provide insights into community sentiment. Think of it as a way to decode the pulse of Reddit!

Features

	•	Keyword Analysis: Track frequently used words to gauge the community’s emotional tone.
	•	Custom Subreddit Selection: Users can input any subreddit name and specify date ranges to tailor their analysis.
	•	Graphical Representations: Visualize trends over time to see how sentiments fluctuate.

Future Goals

I’m looking to open this up for public use as I continue to learn C#. This is my online paper trail of growth, and I’m excited to share this journey with everyone. If you have questions, feedback, or ideas, I’d love to hear them!

Experiment Questions

	•	What are the general trends of sentiment on r/rant leading up to elections?
	•	How do keywords change over time in different subreddits?
	•	What insights can we draw from emotional trends in comments?
	•	How fast will the tool be, and what factors influence its performance?

Let’s get coding and see where this takes us!
